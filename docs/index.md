## Welcome to MineDelivery!
Our project will simulate a city where many customers continuously order food delivery from a restaurant. Customers will make their orders with certain probability distribution during one day. Input is the number of delivery men, locations of all customers, and time-based distributions of their orders during one day. Our goal is to deliver foods to all customers within shortest cumulative waiting time in one day.
