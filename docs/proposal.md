## Summary of the Project
Our project will simulate a city where many customers continuously order food delivery from a restaurant. Customers will make their orders with certain probability distribution during one day. Input is the number of delivery men, locations of all customers, and time-based distributions of their orders during one day. Our goal is to deliver foods to all customers within shortest cumulative waiting time in one day.

## AI/ML Algorithms

## Evaluation Plan
Quantitative: The baseline of our project is to assign each food order to the nearest delivery man and complete all the food delivery orders. We are using several metrics to evaluate our performance:
1. The time to complete all the orders. We will train the agents and decide the best way to arrage them so that all the orders can be completed within the shortest time.
2.
